# I2 benchmark specification

## Synopsis

Benchmark to test sensitivity and False Discovery Rate (FDR) of RNAseq-based poly(A) site identification compared with ground truth (poly(A)-sites identified from orthogonal 3'end seq data).

Input data:

1. Poly(A) sites identified based on RNAseq data using the benchmarked tool
2. Poly(A) sites identified based on orthogonal 3'end seq dataset

Based on the input data the following metrics are computed:

1. Sensitivity = (TP/(TP+FN))
2. FDR = (FP/(TP+FP))

TP - true positives  
FP - false positives  
FN - false negatives

## General info

* **Challenge:** Identification
* **Identifier:** I2
