# I3 benchmark specification

## Synopsis

Benchmark to compare output of tool's RNAseq based site identification to an established atlas of polyA-sites (PolyASite, PolyA_DB). The goal is to calculate precision with respect to data from existing databases for several different distance thresholds.

Input data:

1. Poly(A) sites identified based on RNAseq data using the benchmarked tool
2. Poly(A) sites identified in PolyASite database
3. Poly(A) sites identified in PolyA_DB database

Based on the input data the following metrics are computed:

1. Precision = (TP/(TP+FP))

TP - true positives - PAS identified by the tool and present within X nucleotides of PAS identified in the database  
FP - false positives  - PAS identified by the tool and not present within X nucleotides of PAS identified in the database

The metrics should be calculated for the following thresholds of distance between PAS identified by the tool and PAS present in databases:

- 50 nt
- 100 nt
- 200 nt
